  <h7> Luis Figo believes Lionel Messi may yet force his way through the exits at Camp Nou, with Barcelona warned that “nothing can change your mind” once you set your heart on making a fresh start.

  The six-time Ballon d’Or winner pushed for a move away from the Liga giants over the summer.

  Having grown disillusioned with life at the only club side he has represented over the course of a distinguished career to date, Messi decided that the time was right for a new challenge. The likes of Manchester City and Inter were quick to position themselves at the front of a transfer queue, but no talks could be held as Barca stood firm</h7>
  very club wants to have a player like Messi, but then it depends on factors like the current financial situation at the club, the money he'll cost the club in wages, the will of the player...

  “But generally, in life, if you don't want to be somewhere, in the end there's nothing that can change your mind.”
